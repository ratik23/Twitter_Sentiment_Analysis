# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

In this project, I have implemented a Twitter sentiment analysis model using NLP, that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of the tweets. I have Classified the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for text mining, text analysis, data analysis, data visualization, classification, etc.
